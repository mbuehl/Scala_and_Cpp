//x   10.11 Using composition and inheritance
/*
Composition and inheritance are two ways to define a new class in terms
of another existing class. If what youâ€™re after is primarily code reuse, you
should in general prefer composition to inheritance.
Only inheritance suffers from the fragile base class problem, in which you
can inadvertently break subclasses by changing a superclass.

// Class ArrayElement also has a composition relationship with Array, because its parametric contents
